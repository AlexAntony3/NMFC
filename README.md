### Colour Scheme
![Colour Pallet](assets/images/colour-pallete-pp1.png)

The above image shows the colour scheme that has been decided for the website. I have used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) to help me pick my pallet and the reason these colours have been selected is to represent and match the colour scheme of the team kit. 

| Colour  | Use |

| #363732 | This colour will be used for the text and border colour for images. |
