## Design Choices
### Colour Scheme
![Colour Pallet](assets/images/colour-pallete-pp1.png)

The above image shows the colour scheme that has been decided for the website. I have used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) to help me pick my pallet and the reason these colours have been selected is to represent and match the colour scheme of the team kit. 

| Colour  | Use |
| ------  | --- |
| #363732 | This colour will be used for the text and border colour for images. |
| #F7A278 | This Colour will be used for styling of the contact form. |
| #FAFFD8 | This colour will be used for the background and as contrasting text colour. |
| #8D99AE | This colour will be used for the header, navigation and footer. |
