## Design
### Social Media Icons
For the social media links, all icons was attained using [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). This is because the icons are universally recognised and therefore the user would be able to navigate to the social media sites easily. The social media icons is present in the footer in all pages. 
### Fonts
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") was used to find the fonts that are used in the website. I decided that for this sports related webstite, Roboto is clear and sharp. 


Header and navigational elements uses the Roboto medium 500 font and paragraph elements use the Roboto thin 300. Both the sizes of Roboto are complimentary to each other whilst still being able to see a clear difference between them. 
### Colour Scheme
![Colour Pallet](assets/images/colour-pallete-pp1.png)

The above image shows the colour scheme that has been decided for the website. I have used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) to help me pick my pallet and the reason these colours have been selected is to represent and match the colour scheme of the team kit. 

| Colour  | Use |
| ------  | --- |
| #363732 | This colour will be used for the text and border colour for images. |
| #F7A278 | This Colour will be used for styling of the contact form. |
| #FAFFD8 | This colour will be used for the background and as contrasting text colour. |
| #8D99AE | This colour will be used for the header, navigation and footer. |

### Logo
The logo was created using [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/ "Photopea"). I was able to create a simple and eyecatching logo. The logo also uses the Roboto Font for consistency, it is also coloured in #363732 to match the theme of the website. Furthermore, this logo will be present in all pages in the website in the header. 

### Breakpoints
3 breakpoints have been decided to be implemented into the website. 

|                |Size                             
|----------------|-----------------------------
|Small Screens|    < 480 px     
|Medium Screens| > 480 px
|Large Screens | > 1024 px

These breakpoints were selected with the aid of information provided from [Lambdatest](https://www.lambdatest.com/ "Lambdatest") an showed typical sizes of breakpoints that are utilised by modern websites.

## Testing

Testing was completed on the website post completion of all coding elements. Several issues were noted to be working incorrectly when testing however as most of the issues were resolved; the overall outcome of the website fulfils the requirements. The webstie covers all goals, user's stories, site owners goals, expectations. 

When conducting testing, the following issues were identified and resolved:

* The initial item noted was that the selected colour theme was not working for the website. It had too much contrast and the colours were not matching with each other and hence, it was not aesthethically pleasing. I solved this by testing multiple colour schemes to identify which one was simple yet effective and I learnt that I didn't need to use too many colours and overcomplicate the website. Finally the colour scheme selected is in the colour scheme section above.
* Further testing and review showed that a hamburger icon is required for a modern true mobile/tablet responsive website. This was implemented and the user interface was has greatly improved. A more in-depth review was completed and it was noted for optimal navigational ease, it was best to add the hamburger on the right side instead of the left side.  
* When the table was viewed on tablet/phone version, it webpage squished the picture of the trophy and eventually due to CSS grid would bring the picture under the table. However a solo picture of the trophy on the website didn't make sense and was also not effective. Therefore, I took the decision to remove the picture of the trophy in the mobile/tablet version. This produced a much better looking website. 
* When hovering over the different fields in the contact form, there wasn't any indication that it was the field that the mouse was over. Therefore to solve this, I added a lighter tone than the box. This improved the user interface.
* Only a hover effect was initially used over the navigation items. When I reviewed other webpages, i noticed that there was more of an indication that a nev element was hightlighted. I added a line underneath each section when highlighted for a better user interface.
