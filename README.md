## Design
### Social Media Icons
For the social media links, all icons was attained using [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). This is because the icons are universally recognised and therefore the user would be able to navigate to the social media sites easily. The social media icons is present in the footer in all pages. 
### Fonts
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") was used to find the fonts that are used in the website. I decided that for this sports related webstite, Roboto is clear and sharp. 


Header and navigational elements uses the Roboto medium 500 font and paragraph elements use the Roboto thin 300. Both the sizes of Roboto are complimentary to each other whilst still being able to see a clear difference between them. 
### Colour Scheme
![Colour Pallet](assets/images/colour-pallete-pp1.png)

The above image shows the colour scheme that has been decided for the website. I have used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) to help me pick my pallet and the reason these colours have been selected is to represent and match the colour scheme of the team kit. 

| Colour  | Use |
| ------  | --- |
| #363732 | This colour will be used for the text and border colour for images. |
| #F7A278 | This Colour will be used for styling of the contact form. |
| #FAFFD8 | This colour will be used for the background and as contrasting text colour. |
| #8D99AE | This colour will be used for the header, navigation and footer. |

### Logo
The logo was created using [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/ "Photopea"). I was able to create a simple and eyecatching logo. The logo also uses the Roboto Font for consistency, it is also coloured in #363732 to match the theme of the website. Furthermore, this logo will be present in all pages in the website in the header.
